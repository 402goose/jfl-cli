Created centralized path utility (src/utils/jfl-paths.ts):\n   - JFL_PATHS for config/data/cache directories\n   - JFL_FILES for specific file paths\n   - Cross-platform support (Linux/macOS/Windows)\n   - Migration detection functions\n\n2. Created auto-migration logic (src/utils/jfl-migration.ts):\n   - Automatic migration on first run\n   - Safe copy-then-delete approach\n   - Error handling and rollback\n   - Silent mode for background migration\n\n3. Updated ALL references (~140+ locations):\n   - CLI entry point (src/index.ts) - migration check at startup\n   - Core utils: jfl-config.ts\n   - Commands: update.ts, service-agent.ts, voice.ts, services.ts, service-manager.ts, context-hub.ts, orchestrate.ts, services-scan.ts\n   - UI components: services-manager.tsx, service-dashboard.ts\n   - MCP servers: service-mcp-server.ts\n   - Lib: service-dependencies.ts\n   - Tests: session-namespace.test.ts\n\n4.

Migration Safety:\n   - Auto-detects legacy ~/.jfl/\n   - Copies files to new locations\n   - Validates migration success\n   - Only deletes legacy dir if successful\n\n6. All tests pass (43/43):\n   - Updated session namespace tests\n   - All XDG path assertions pass\n   - Build succeeds without errors\n\nProject-local .jfl/ directories remain unchanged.
