API exposes GET /services, POST /services/:name/start|stop|restart, DELETE /services/:name. Daemon management matches context-hub pattern. Updated services.json to add health_url for context-hub. Improved ensure-context-hub.ts to check health endpoint before starting (prevents unnecessary restarts). Updated services-manager TUI to use new API (temporarily on port 3402 due to PM2 conflict). Context-hub restart loop is now fixed - service runs stably.","files":["src/commands/service-manager.ts","src/index.ts","src/utils/ensure-context-hub.ts","src/ui/services-manager.tsx","~/.jfl/services.json"],"incomplete":["Port conflict with PM2 on 3401 - need to make port configurable or resolve conflict","TUI hardcoded to port 3402 - should read from config","Service Manager not auto-started yet - need to add to session hooks"],"next":"Test TUI with Service Manager API, add service-manager to session hooks for auto-start, make port configurable"}
