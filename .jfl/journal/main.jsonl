Sessions now create branches instead of separate working directories.","detail":"Removed all worktree infrastructure from JFL session management. Before: SessionStart created worktrees via session-init.sh, Claude had to CD into worktree, journal symlinked back to main repo, multiple tracking files. After: SessionStart creates session branch in main repo, Claude works in main repo on session branch, journal writes directly (no symlink), simplified cleanup. Updated session-init.sh to create branches instead of worktrees, removed crash reconciliation for stale worktrees, simplified session-cleanup.sh to just merge branch and delete (no worktree removal), updated CLAUDE.md instructions in 3 locations to remove CD-to-worktree steps, updated hooks to reference simplified output. Benefits: simpler mental model, less disk usage, faster initialization, fewer moving parts.","files":["CLAUDE.md","template/CLAUDE.md","scripts/session/session-init.sh","scripts/session/session-cleanup.sh","template/scripts/session/session-init.sh","template/scripts/session/session-cleanup.sh","template/.claude/settings.json"],"incomplete":[],"next":"Test session management end-to-end to verify branches work correctly without worktrees"}

Automatically onboards services, removes them from references/, and updates CLAUDE.md.","detail":"Built a migration tool to clean up GTM architecture. Problem: Services were mixed with reference material in references/ directory as git submodules. Solution: Service manager should handle dependencies, references/ should only have gitignored reference material. The migrate-services command finds all service repos in references/ (directories with .git), registers each with service manager via jfl service add, removes them from references/, updates CLAUDE.md with service manager usage instructions, and adds references/ to .gitignore.

Root cause: If previous session crashed, context-hub serve process becomes orphaned (holds port 4242 but no PID file). The ensure command checked PID file, saw it missing, tried to start but port was blocked → failed silently. Fix: ensure now checks if port 4242 is in use before starting. If port blocked but no PID file exists, it detects orphaned process, uses lsof to find PID, kills it with SIGTERM, waits 500ms for cleanup, then starts fresh daemon. This ensures context-hub ALWAYS runs after SessionStart hook regardless of previous session state.","files":["src/commands/context-hub.ts"],"incomplete":[],"next":"Monitor for any other session cleanup issues"}

Added error handlers, heartbeat, better spawning, and improved shutdown handling.","detail":"Root causes: 1) No uncaught exception handlers - any error crashed daemon silently, 2) Port conflicts caused immediate shutdown, 3) No heartbeat - event loop could close, 4) Spawn used unreliable paths. Fixes: Added uncaughtException/unhandledRejection handlers that log but don't exit, improved EADDRINUSE handling, added 60s heartbeat to keep event loop alive, use jfl command from PATH for spawning, verify process started before writing PID, wait 500ms for stability check, better shutdown with timeout. Result: Daemon now starts reliably, stays running, responds to API requests, survives extended periods.

Added 'logs' case to context-hub command that spawns TUI process. Fixed ES module issues: added JSX support to tsconfig (jsx: react), installed @types/react, fixed __dirname → import.meta.url conversion, fixed require → import for spawn.
