# JFL - Just Fucking Launch

**Your context layer. Any project. Any AI.**

A CLI toolkit that structures GTM campaigns from idea to launch. JFL creates workspaces where strategy, brand, code, and content work together—powered by AI agents that understand your full context across sessions.

## What JFL Does

JFL is built around three core systems:

**Context Hub** — Unified context layer that aggregates journal entries, knowledge docs, and code headers. Any AI can query it to understand what happened across sessions, what decisions were made, and what code does.

**Synopsis** — Work summaries that roll up journal + commits + file headers into readable reports. Ask "what happened this week?" or "what did Alex work on?" and get structured answers.

**Session Management** — Git worktree-based isolation for parallel work. Each session auto-commits, auto-merges, and cleans up. No more lost work or merge conflicts.

Plus: Brand generation, content creation, x402 crypto micropayments, and a growing skill library.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g jfl
```

**Requirements:** Node ≥18

JFL automatically installs dependencies including Context Hub MCP and x402 payment tools.

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
# Initialize a GTM workspace
jfl init my-product-gtm

# Check status
cd my-product-gtm
jfl status

# View campaign dashboard
jfl hud

# See what happened recently
jfl synopsis 24

# Start interactive session (auto-updates on first run)
jfl
```

---

---

## Architecture

JFL creates GTM workspaces that are **separate from product code**:

```
my-product-gtm/              ← GTM workspace (strategy, content, brand)
├── .jfl/
│   ├── config.json          ← Project settings
│   ├── journal/             ← Session journals (JSONL)
│   └── context-hub.pid      ← Context Hub daemon
├── product/                 ← SUBMODULE → your-product-repo
├── knowledge/               ← Strategy docs (VISION, ROADMAP, etc.)
├── content/                 ← Generated marketing content
├── suggestions/             ← Contributor workspaces
├── .claude/skills/          ← JFL skills
└── CLAUDE.md                ← AI instructions

your-product-repo/           ← SEPARATE REPO (all code)
├── src/
├── cli/
└── ...
```

**Why separate?**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Product code doesn't get polluted with GTM docs
- Multiple GTMs can reference the same product
- `jfl update` updates GTM toolkit without touching product code
- Team can work on product independently

---

## Context Hub

Context Hub is a local daemon (port 4242) that provides unified context to any AI:

```bash
# Start Context Hub
jfl context-hub start

# Check status
jfl context-hub status

# Stop daemon
jfl context-hub stop
```

**What it aggregates:**
- **Journal entries** — What happened across sessions (`.jfl/journal/*.jsonl`)
- **Knowledge docs** — Strategy, vision, roadmap (`knowledge/*.md`)
- **Code headers** — `@purpose`, `@spec`, `@decision` tags from files

**MCP Integration:**
Context Hub exposes MCP tools that Claude Code and other AIs can use:
- `context_get` — Get unified context (journal + knowledge + code)
- `context_search` — Semantic search across all sources
- `context_status` — Check daemon status
- `context_sessions` — See activity from other sessions

Add to your `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "jfl-context": {
    "command": "jfl-context-hub-mcp"
  }
}
```

---

## Synopsis - Work Summaries

Synopsis aggregates journal entries, git commits, and code file headers to answer "what happened?"

```bash
# Last 24 hours, all authors
jfl synopsis 24

# Last 8 hours
jfl synopsis 8

# What did Alex work on in last 48 hours?
jfl synopsis 48 alex

# Filter by git author name
jfl synopsis 24 --author "Andrew"
```

**Output includes:**
- Summary of features, fixes, decisions
- Time audit breakdown (infra vs features vs docs)
- Per-team-member contributions
- Health checks (too much infra? not enough outreach?)
- Next steps from journal entries
- Incomplete/stubbed items

---

## Session Management

Work in isolated git worktrees with automatic commit/merge:

```bash
# Create new session (creates worktree + branch)
jfl session create

# List active sessions
jfl session list

# End session (merges to main, removes worktree)
jfl session end [session-name]

# Auto-commit running in background (every 2 min)
./scripts/session/auto-commit.sh start
```

**Each session:**
- Isolated git worktree (parallel work without conflicts)
- Auto-commits knowledge/, content/, suggestions/ every 2 minutes
- Auto-merges to main on session end
- Removes worktree and branch when merged
- Writes journal entries (enforced by hooks)

**SessionStart hook:**
- CD to worktree
- Sync repos (jfl-gtm + product submodule)
- Run doctor check (detect issues)
- Start Context Hub
- Show HUD dashboard

**Stop hook:**
- Auto-commit uncommitted changes
- Merge to main (with conflict handling)
- Cleanup worktree and branch
- Validate journal entry exists

---

## Authentication

**GitHub OAuth:**
```bash
jfl login
```

**x402 Crypto Wallet ($5/day micropayments):**
```bash
jfl login --x402
```

Enables:
- Gasless USDC transfers (no ETH needed)
- $5/day Day Pass payments
- httpcat-cli bundled and configured

View auth status:
```bash
jfl status
jfl wallet
```

## Knowledge Layer

JFL structures your GTM knowledge:

```
knowledge/
├── VISION.md              # What you're building
├── NARRATIVE.md           # How you tell the story
├── THESIS.md              # Why you'll win
├── ROADMAP.md             # What ships when
├── BRAND_BRIEF.md         # Brand inputs
├── BRAND_DECISIONS.md     # Finalized brand choices
├── VOICE_AND_TONE.md      # How the brand speaks
└── TASKS.md               # Master task list
```

These docs are the source of truth. AIs read them to generate content, make decisions, and maintain consistency.

---

## Auto-Update

JFL automatically checks for updates on session start (24-hour cache):

- **Minor/patch versions** — Auto-updates silently
- **Major versions** — Prompts for approval

**Skip auto-update:**
```bash
jfl --no-update
```

**Manual update:**
```bash
jfl update                   # Pull latest skills and CLAUDE.md
jfl update --dry             # Preview changes first
```

**What gets updated:**
- `.claude/skills/` — Latest skill implementations
- `CLAUDE.md` — Latest AI instructions
- `scripts/` — Session management scripts
- `templates/` — Doc templates

**What's preserved:**
- `knowledge/` — Your strategy docs
- `content/` — Your generated content
- `product/` — Your product code
- `.jfl/config.json` — Project settings

---

## Journal Protocol

Every session MUST write journal entries. The Stop hook blocks if no entry exists.

**Entry format:**
```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "ts": "2026-01-28T10:00:00.000Z",
  "session": "session-goose-20260128-1014-00cec4",
  "type": "feature|fix|decision|milestone|discovery",
  "status": "complete|incomplete|blocked",
  "title": "Short title",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence summary",
  "detail": "Full description with context",
  "files": ["file1.ts", "file2.ts"],
  "incomplete": ["what's not done"],
  "next": "what should happen next"
}
```

**Write entries when:**
- Feature completed
- Decision made
- Bug fixed
- Milestone reached
- Session ending

Journal entries become searchable via Context Hub and Synopsis.

---

## File Headers (Required for Code)

Every `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` file MUST have a header with `@purpose`:

```typescript
/**
 * Component/Module Name
 *
 * Brief description of what this does.
 *
 * @purpose One-line description of file's purpose
 * @spec Optional: link to spec (e.g., PLATFORM_SPEC.md#sessions)
 * @decision Optional: decision slug (e.g., journal/2026-01.md#per-session)
 */
```

Enables:
- Synopsis to extract context from files
- Codebase understanding without reading full files
- Decision traceability
