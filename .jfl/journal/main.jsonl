Sessions now create branches instead of separate working directories.","detail":"Removed all worktree infrastructure from JFL session management. Before: SessionStart created worktrees via session-init.sh, Claude had to CD into worktree, journal symlinked back to main repo, multiple tracking files. After: SessionStart creates session branch in main repo, Claude works in main repo on session branch, journal writes directly (no symlink), simplified cleanup. Updated session-init.sh to create branches instead of worktrees, removed crash reconciliation for stale worktrees, simplified session-cleanup.sh to just merge branch and delete (no worktree removal), updated CLAUDE.md instructions in 3 locations to remove CD-to-worktree steps, updated hooks to reference simplified output. Benefits: simpler mental model, less disk usage, faster initialization, fewer moving parts.","files":["CLAUDE.md","template/CLAUDE.md","scripts/session/session-init.sh","scripts/session/session-cleanup.sh","template/scripts/session/session-init.sh","template/scripts/session/session-cleanup.sh","template/.claude/settings.json"],"incomplete":[],"next":"Test session management end-to-end to verify branches work correctly without worktrees"}
