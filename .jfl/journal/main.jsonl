Path resolution now supports ~/.openclaw (primary) with ~/.clawdbot fallback.","detail":"Could not rename top-level clawdbot command to openclaw since that name is already taken by the OpenClaw agent protocol command (session-start, session-end, heartbeat, etc.). Solution: added jfl openclaw plugin [setup|status] subcommands to the existing openclaw command. Added resolveGatewayDir() for ~/.openclaw → ~/.clawdbot fallback, getConfigPath() for openclaw.json → clawdbot.json fallback, renamed isClawdbotInstalled to isGatewayInstalled with binary checks for both openclaw and clawdbot. All user-facing strings updated to say OpenClaw. Not-installed message points to https://openclaw.dev.","files":["src/commands/clawdbot.ts","src/index.ts"],"next":"PR #4 open into main - https://github.com/402goose/jfl-cli/pull/4"}
