Sessions now create branches instead of separate working directories.","detail":"Removed all worktree infrastructure from JFL session management. Before: SessionStart created worktrees via session-init.sh, Claude had to CD into worktree, journal symlinked back to main repo, multiple tracking files. After: SessionStart creates session branch in main repo, Claude works in main repo on session branch, journal writes directly (no symlink), simplified cleanup. Updated session-init.sh to create branches instead of worktrees, removed crash reconciliation for stale worktrees, simplified session-cleanup.sh to just merge branch and delete (no worktree removal), updated CLAUDE.md instructions in 3 locations to remove CD-to-worktree steps, updated hooks to reference simplified output. Benefits: simpler mental model, less disk usage, faster initialization, fewer moving parts.","files":["CLAUDE.md","template/CLAUDE.md","scripts/session/session-init.sh","scripts/session/session-cleanup.sh","template/scripts/session/session-init.sh","template/scripts/session/session-cleanup.sh","template/.claude/settings.json"],"incomplete":[],"next":"Test session management end-to-end to verify branches work correctly without worktrees"}

Automatically onboards services, removes them from references/, and updates CLAUDE.md.","detail":"Built a migration tool to clean up GTM architecture. Problem: Services were mixed with reference material in references/ directory as git submodules. Solution: Service manager should handle dependencies, references/ should only have gitignored reference material. The migrate-services command finds all service repos in references/ (directories with .git), registers each with service manager via jfl service add, removes them from references/, updates CLAUDE.md with service manager usage instructions, and adds references/ to .gitignore. Created comprehensive usage guide in docs/SERVICE_MIGRATION.md covering migration steps, best practices, and troubleshooting.","files":["src/commands/migrate-services.ts","src/index.ts","docs/SERVICE_MIGRATION.md"],"incomplete":[],"next":"Test migration on actual GTM projects (httpcat, gtm) to verify it works with real services"}
